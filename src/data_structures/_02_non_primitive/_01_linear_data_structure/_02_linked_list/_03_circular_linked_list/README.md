# Circular Linked List

A circular linked list is a data structure where the last node connects back to the first, forming a loop. This structure allows for continuous traversal without any interruptions. Circular linked lists are especially helpful for tasks like scheduling and managing playlists, this allowing for smooth navigation

## What is a Circular Linked List?
A circular linked list is a special type of linked list where all the nodes are connected to form a circle. Unlike a regular linked list, which ends with a node pointing to NULL, the last node in a circular linked list points back to the first node. This means that you can keep traversing the list without ever reaching a NULL value.
