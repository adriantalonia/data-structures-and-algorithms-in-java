# Array

**Array** is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access. Each element has a unique index number.

### Characteristics of Array Data Structure:
- **Homogeneous Elements:** All elements within an array must be of the same data type.
- **Contiguous Memory Allocation:** In most programming languages, elements in an array are stored in contiguous (adjacent) memory locations.
- **Zero-Based Indexing:** In many programming languages, arrays use zero-based indexing, which means that the first element is accessed with an index of 0, the second with an index of 1, and so on.
- **Random Access:** Arrays provide **constant-time (O(1))** access to elements. This means that regardless of the size of the array, it takes the same amount of time to access any element based on its index.
